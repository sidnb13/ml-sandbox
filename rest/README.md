# Reinforced Self-Training (ReST)

A Jax implementation of the Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) algorithm from [Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998).

# TODO

- [x] implement small encoder-decoder transformer.
- [x] dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/flan
- [x] reward model `microsoft/deberta-v3-large"` 
- [ ] pretrain transformer model
- [ ] implement ReST algorithm
- [ ] experimental trials going by paper figures
